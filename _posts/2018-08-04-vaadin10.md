Since a few days, I've started exploring Vaadin 10, the new and shiny version of Vaadin.

Vaadin 10 comes with a new library of controls, called "flow". The old code remains functional, as long as the package of the control classes are renamed.

Surprisingly, the old approach of starting a new project by using the Apache Maven archetype is not available anymore. Probably because of marketing reasons, getting a new project in Vaadin now requires to sign up on their web site and use the online wizard. The startup project is a fully fledged application, composed of two tabs. The new application has CSS, Polymer templates, HTML. The good news is that it compiles and runs from the first attempt, which is something to expect, since it has no database or other external dependencies. The bad news is the increased complexity of the "bare bones" application. How complex would it be when reaching production capabilities?

So my first attempt was to simplify the existing project. I would like to have the basic No-HTML/CSS/JS layout of the previous Vaadin version.
