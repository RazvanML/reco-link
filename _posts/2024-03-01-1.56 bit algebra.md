This week I've looked at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764">LLM optimization of using 1.58 bit algebra</a> to speed up the training and transformation.

The idea is to operate with three states: $\{-1,0,1\}$. To store such a number in a native way, we will require two bits, however, by using modulos, more data can be stored within a block of bits.

Since $n$ bits can store $2^n$ states, storing $m$ tri-state numbers will require $3^m$ states. So $2^n=3^m$ so $n=m \frac{ln(3)}{ln(2)}$
