Most of the record linkage technique imagine two tables, composed of records and a set of association rules. Is this it?
Well, my software goes beyond this, exploring the relational dimension of data. This post is about matching sets of 
records associated to one data record.

The structured data is always organized by the relational model, meaning that a record usually points to one or more other
records from different tables. There is a virtual link back, the pointed record is associated to the master record.
This way, two types of relations between items can be exploited in record linkage. Considering the table ```A```
 and a table ```B``` endowed with a foreign key to ```A```, one record of ```B``` points to exactly one record in
 ```A``` and virtually one record in ```A``` can refer multiple records of ```B```.

In the context of record linkage, let us consider on one side the tables ```A``` and ```B``` from above to be linked to
 ```A'``` and ```B'```. 

The relations observed are of two types:

* *One-to-many* computes a score of a pair of two records from ```A```  and ```A'```,
 given the already computed scores between the corresponding records in ```B``` and ```B'```. 

* *Many-to-one* provides a rule of similarity computed on a pair of records in ```B``` and ```B'``` considering
the score of the referred records in ```A``` and ```A'```.

The relation is just one criterion, the records may benefit of additional comparison criteria.

The following example is used to illustrate the concept.


The two tables ```A``` and ```A'``` are defined as:

``` 
ID,Name
1,Group 1
2,Group 2
3,Group 3
4,Group 4
``` 

and

``` 
ID,Name
1,Group one
2,Second group
3,Third Group
4,Fourth Group
``` 

No criterion is provided for the similarity of the two
