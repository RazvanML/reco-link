The <a href="/reco-link/2015-10-28/Basic-Model/">previous post</a> relied exclusively on the exact match of name. Out of the ten names, 
only two of them enjoyed the perfect equality. It is obvious that measuring the "degree of similarity" between the names will yield some better results. One such measure is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance">"Jaro-Winkler"</a> metric from <a href="#b1">[1]</a>. This measure returns a value between zero and one, with one for the equal strings and zero for the totally different strings. The measure factors in the composing letters of the string, their sequentiality as well as their position inside the string.

To use this metric instead of plain string comparison, the entity match rule has to be changed accordingly:

```xml
		<match name="matchperson" left="sales" right="support" lcard="ZEROONE"
			rcard="ZEROONE" >
			<rules>
				<rule name="byname" lfield="name" rfield="name" type="STR_JARO_WRINKLER"  >
					<score alpha="0.9" beta="0.9" threshold="0.85" >
					</score>
				</rule>
			</rules>
		</match>
```
The significant change is ```type="STR_JARO_WRINKLER"```. A scoring criterion has been added as well. The meaning of parameters is as following:
* ```alpha``` is the probability of the test to return true, in case of a matching entity
* ```beta``` is the probability of the test to return false, in case of a mismatching entity
* ```threshold``` is a cutoff value used to provide the "match" and "no match" verdict.

The value choices for the three parameters will be the subject of a future post. Let's assume that the values are just right.

With this change, the result is as following (mismatches were marked manually):

With this approach, the record linkage identified 10 linkages (this is the expected number), but out of them only five are correct. There are two causes contributing to this issue: first, the other data, like address, company and product are not used, and second, the quantitative part of the string similarity is discarded once passing the threshold.

By signaling the mismatches, the result turns in:
